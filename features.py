        Computes the frequencies of formants of the window of audio data, along with their bandwidths.
    
        A formant is a frequency band over which there is a concentration of energy. 
        They correspond to tones produced by the vocal tract and are therefore often 
        used to characterize vowels, which have distinct frequencies. In the task of 
        speaker identification, it can be used to characterize a person's speech 
        patterns.
